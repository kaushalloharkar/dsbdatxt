Descriptive Statistics - Measures of Central Tendency and variability
Perform the following operations on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)
1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for
a dataset (age, income etc.) with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative
(categorical) variable. For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and
quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by the
age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the categorical
variable.
2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details like percentile, mean,
standard deviation etc. of the species of ‘Iris-setosa’, ‘Iris-versicolor’ and ‘Iris-versicolor’
of iris.csv datase
